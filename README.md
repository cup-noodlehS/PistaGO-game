Heavily inspired by the game Sushi Go! by Phil Walker Harding, Pista Go! is a fast-paced, and strategic card-drafting game that challenges the players to come up with a set of the most flavorful dishes to score the highest points. The game centralizes the concept of formulating a meal from a diverse selection of Filipino dishes. As each card represents a specific type of dish, players must strategically pick which cards to use, keep, and pass, to assemble a set of cards that maximizes their scoring potential.
